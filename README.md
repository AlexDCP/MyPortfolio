# <My-Portfolio>

## Description

This is a portfolio of mine to show the work I have done, and to showcase what I have learned. That said it is also a good show of where I started and how much further I have to go. We were meant to have a functional nav bar and somewhere showing what we have completed. My prework website is from when we were getting ready for the bootcamp, and the first challenge we went over to fix accessibility. The placeholders will hopefully be amazing projects I complete one day soon!
